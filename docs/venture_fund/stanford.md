investment process primarily occurs during Stanford's winter quarter (January to April).

## Additional Information

Launched in 2015, the GSB Impact Fund is a student-managed evergreen fund that invests in 
early stage for-profit ventures, seeking both attractive financial returns and measurable 
social value. All returns are reinvested into new enterprises.

As a student-managed fund, the GSB Impact Fund provides current GSB students on the 
ground learning experiences and understanding of the financial returns on socially and 
environmentally-driven ventures.

Under the guidance of faculty advisors, Professors Paul Pfleiderer and Kenneth Singleton, 
who are joined on the Investment Committee by alumni and expert practitioners, the fund 
is housed by the Center for Social Innovation at Stanford Graduate School of Business.

The GSB Impact Fund evaluates companies for their strong business fundamentals and 
compelling social and environmental impact. We believe that the most impactful social 
enterprises are, first-and-foremost, viable businesses that offer scalability of 
financial returns and measurable impact.

Companies and entrepreneurs that have successfully gone through our process typically 
feature:
- Products or services that have demonstrated market traction (through customer usage or 
existing revenues)
- Dedicated leaders with a desire to make a social impact in one of the Fund's target 
sectors
- C-Corp and B-Corp structures
