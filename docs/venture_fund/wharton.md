## Application Process

All funding decisions are made by the Innovation Fund Investment Team, which is composed 
of current students from across the University of Pennsylvania.

Applicants are evaluated on criteria relevant to the specific Innovation Award, aligned 
with the venture’s development stage. See each Innovation Fund award webpage for details.

### Validation Award

The Innovation Fund Validation Award supports Penn student entrepreneurs in the 
validation phase of venture development. In AY 2023-2024, selected recipients receive an 
award of $500. These funds are intended for validating key assumptions with 
hypothesis-driven testing.

At the Validation stage, you should have a plan to test assumptions related to the 
Desirability and Viability of your idea.

Applicants will need to provide general information about the team and the venture.

* Application form question topics include - 
- Innovation (type and scope)
- Problem and proposed solution (Including how are potential users solving this problem now)
- Validation plan to test key assumptions focused on desirability and viability
- Use of funds and an itemized budget
- Potential mission-driven impact (for social enterprises)
* 1-2 minute pitch video
* If you previously applied for an Innovation Fund award, you will also be asked to 
provide details regarding - 
- The venture’s progress since your last application
- Any changes to your team
- How you’ve addressed the feedback from the Investment Team

If you previously applied for and/or received an Innovation Fund award for a different 
venture, you will be asked to provide a status update for that venture.

## Investment Process

Our process includes leadership team reviews, diligence of historical sales and 
customers, evaluations of market growth opportunities, comparable company analysis, 
detailed financial model reviews, and impact theory of change and efficacy analysis. The 
investment process primarily occurs during Stanford's winter quarter (January to April).

## Investment Criteria

The Innovation Fund awards are for early-stage ventures founded and led by one or more 
Penn students. The venture should be a new venture founded while the team lead and/or 
team members are current Penn students.

The team leader must be a founder of the venture and a currently enrolled student in a 
degree-pursuing program at Penn. Students on a Leave of Absence and alumni are not 
eligible to be a team leader.

Ventures that have received more than $150k in institutional funding are not eligible, 
unless the funding was received while the Team Leader and team members were active 
students at the University of Pennsylvania.

All submitted materials must be the original work of the participating team. By 
submitting an application, a team and each of its individual members warrants that they 
do not infringe on any proprietary or other right of others.

An application will be disqualified if any of the following situations occur - 

- A team member or the venture is in violation of the University’s Code of Student 
Conduct, Code of Academic Integrity, or other Penn policy
- A team member or the venture is in violation of any local, state, and/or federal law
- The application does not present sufficient content or material appropriate to merit 
review
- A team member, the application, or the venture has not complied with applicable rules
