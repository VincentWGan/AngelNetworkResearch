## Investment Criteria

We are enthusiastic about entrepreneurs and passionate teams pursuing their dreams. We 
predominantly invest in early-stage technology start-ups. Wharton Alumni Angels seeks to 
add value and actively provide mentoring and assistance to young companies.

Founded in 2016, Wharton Alumni Angels is an active angel investment group composed of 
University of Pennsylvania alumni and non-Penn alumni who have joined our community. Our 
members are entrepreneurs, senior business executives, and institutional investors with a 
global reach. Our members are located on every continent and invest in start-ups worldwide.

We have a deep network and working relationships with venture capital funds, other angel 
networks, and innovation ecosystems globally to cultivate the growth of technology 
start-ups.  We do not focus on specific verticals or industries.

The group of Wharton Alumni Angels issues one check to each portfolio company as a group 
investor. Here is what we look for from early-stage companies, but have exceptions:

- Angel, pre-seed & seed stage rounds seek $750K - $5M (We have exceptions)
- Minimum of $500K left on the round
- Compelling teams with a vision for sector-defining companies
- Software companies should have pilot customers ready
- Hardware/Deep-tech/Medical startups require MVP with a compelling growth path
- Typically a minimum cheque size of $50K
- Have a lead investor ready at the time of application

## Investment Process

Once a Full Member knows that they are considering an investment in a deal they should 
indicate their consideration by using the deal consideration tool on the Member Portal. 
In case the deal is oversubscribed, this submission through the Member Portal is used to 
allocate investment rights to members on a 'First Come First Serve' basis. You can also 
indicate whether you'd consider being the Deal Lead on. the form

Investors who are participating in the deal are responsible for the level of due 
diligence that they feel is appropriate (see separate Due Diligence question in the FAQ)

Investing FUll Members will receive the deal document such as purchase agreement from the 
company and should review that carefully. Our leadership team is available to support and 
answer questions. When an entrepreneur does not have any deal documents and no other 
investors, we can propose a deal structure that best suits the deal. Investors must 
ensure that all documents are suitable for their local jurisdiction.

Investment documents vary deal by deal. The definitive deal documents with the company 
will be signed by Wharton Alumni Angels when investing via the SPV. In all deals, 
investors should also carefully review the definitive documents.

## Additional Information

### How can I see the deal pipeline? 

You can access the deal flow management platform via the Member Portal. We use a 
member-only, online tool for managing our deal funnel and pre-investment workflow. Most 
members will have view-only rights for deals. Other members (such as screening committee 
members and admins) have expanded user rights.
