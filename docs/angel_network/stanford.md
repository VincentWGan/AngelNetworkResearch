## Membership Description

Stanford Angels & Entrepreneurs helps angel investors find exceptional startups, make 
smart investment decisions, and support enthusiastic entrepreneurs as part of the broader 
Stanford community.

Angels can help entrepreneurs by writing a check, giving informal advice, making a 
connection, joining a board, or giving a talk. SA&E provides educational programs to help 
angels make wise choices in applying time and money in these endeavors.

SA&E links angel investors to promising, groundbreaking startups. Members of the Stanford 
community have founded Google, Yahoo, eBay, Cisco, HP, Intuit, PayPal, LinkedIn, Sun, 
Electronic Arts, VMware, Netflix and Netscape, among others. We can’t promise SA&E will 
find the next billion-dollar Stanford company, but we can promise fun in the search 
process.

Stanford Angels & Entrepreneurs provides educational programs, access to experienced 
entrepreneurs, relationships with potential investors, and a supportive community with a 
shared Stanford bond.

SA&E entrepreneurs and Stanford students have opportunities to listen and learn from 
other entrepreneurs pitching to the group. They participate in discussions with investors 
about the pros and cons of startups, and to help understand what it is like to sit on the 
angel side of table.

We follow a broad approach in entrepreneurial education. While we do offer 
learning-oriented events, we believe the best education comes from experience.

## Membership Eligibility

SA&E membership is open to all Stanford alumni and affiliates including students, faculty, 
staff, and parents or spouses of alumni or students. At the discretion of the SA&E Board 
of Directors, people outside of Stanford who share the interests and objectives of the 
club may also be granted membership as “non-affiliated” members.

In order to attend a pitch session, angel investors must attest to accredited investor 
status. Non-accredited investors are welcome to join as members and attend all other 
events.

Annual fees:
Angel investors – $100
Entrepreneurs – FREE

## Investment Criteria

Generally, our investing members are most interested in startups that could generate 
venture-scale returns, and they have expressed a preference for companies that meet the 
following criteria:

US-based companies whose value proposition is enabled by innovative software or hardware 
technologies.
Companies that are raising no more than US $2M, with a maximum pre-money valuation (or 
pre-money cap, if raised on a convertible note) of US $10M.
One or more investors with relevant domain expertise have already committed capital to 
the company, or a US-based venture capital firm is leading the round.

## Investment Process

If you are interested in seeking investments from SA&E members, please send a summary to 
submission@stanfordaande.com. All investment opportunities go through the following 
process:

Initial qualification by the SA&E investment committee. This step may involve email 
exchanges, or a phone call / video chat / in-person meeting depending on the nature of 
the opportunity.
Pitch meeting. The company presents to SA&E members who are interested in learning more 
about the opportunity.
Due diligence. If at least two SA&E members are interested in investing in the company, 
SA&E would coordinate the due diligence process, focusing on the key questions identified
by the members.
Terms discussion and closing. If all goes well, the investing members would proceed to 
discuss investment terms with the company and work towards closing the transaction 
individually. If the company has already received a term sheet from a lead investor by 
this time, the members would often choose to invest under the same terms.
Information rights letter. The company grants information rights to the SA&E leadership 
team such that the group can forward management updates to the members who have invested 
in the company.
Unless the company objects (such as wishing to remain in stealth mode), the company logo 
is listed on the SA&E website. A company is considered part of the SA&E portfolio if it 
has received investments from at least two SA&E members.
