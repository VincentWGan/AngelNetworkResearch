## Investment Criteria

We are enthusiastic about entrepreneurs and passionate teams pursuing their dreams. We 
predominantly invest in early-stage technology start-ups. Wharton Alumni Angels seeks to 
add value and actively provide mentoring and assistance to young companies.

Founded in 2016, Wharton Alumni Angels is an active angel investment group composed of 
University of Pennsylvania alumni and non-Penn alumni who have joined our community. Our 
members are entrepreneurs, senior business executives, and institutional investors with a 
global reach. Our members are located on every continent and invest in start-ups worldwide.

We have a deep network and working relationships with venture capital funds, other angel 
networks, and innovation ecosystems globally to cultivate the growth of technology 
start-ups.  We do not focus on specific verticals or industries.

The group of Wharton Alumni Angels issues one check to each portfolio company as a group 
investor. Here is what we look for from early-stage companies, but have exceptions:

- Angel, pre-seed & seed stage rounds seek $750K - $5M (We have exceptions)
- Minimum of $500K left on the round
- Compelling teams with a vision for sector-defining companies
- Software companies should have pilot customers ready
- Hardware/Deep-tech/Medical startups require MVP with a compelling growth path
- Typically a minimum cheque size of $50K
- Have a lead investor ready at the time of application

## Investment Process

Once a Full Member knows that they are considering an investment in a deal they should 
indicate their consideration by using the deal consideration tool on the Member Portal. 
In case the deal is oversubscribed, this submission through the Member Portal is used to 
allocate investment rights to members on a 'First Come First Serve' basis. You can also 
indicate whether you'd consider being the Deal Lead on. the form

Investors who are participating in the deal are responsible for the level of due 
diligence that they feel is appropriate (see separate Due Diligence question in the FAQ)

Investing FUll Members will receive the deal document such as purchase agreement from the 
company and should review that carefully. Our leadership team is available to support and 
answer questions. When an entrepreneur does not have any deal documents and no other 
investors, we can propose a deal structure that best suits the deal. Investors must 
ensure that all documents are suitable for their local jurisdiction.

Investment documents vary deal by deal. The definitive deal documents with the company 
will be signed by Wharton Alumni Angels when investing via the SPV. In all deals, 
investors should also carefully review the definitive documents.

## Additional Information

### How can I see the deal pipeline? 

You can access the deal flow management platform via the Member Portal. We use a 
member-only, online tool for managing our deal funnel and pre-investment workflow. Most 
members will have view-only rights for deals. Other members (such as screening committee 
members and admins) have expanded user rights.

### What is the minimum investment amount? 

This is a multi-part question.

Each company we seek to invest in may set their own minimum check size. Wharton Alumni 
Angels syndicate all of our members' investments in a company into an SPV and we then 
write one check to the company. If our aggregate investment from all interested members 
is below a company's minimum we may not be able to invest.
For any single investment in a company, a member's minimum check size is $5,000 USD or 
equivalent.
Per the member agreement, we expect our Full Members to invest $20,000 USD per year on 
average. In years when a Full member cannot do so, we ask that members contribute time to
volunteer by supporting the deal process.
Investors also share the expenses of servicing the SPV. See the separate question 
regarding SPV expenses.

### How are deal negotiations managed? 

One of the investors in the deal will serve as the 'Deal Lead'. This person is a single 
point of contact for the entrepreneur. The regional Managing Director and the Club 
President should be informed periodically on the proposed deal terms in case there are 
terms that won’t work for our structure or may otherwise adversely compromise our 
position in the deal.

If none of the deal investors feel experienced enough to negotiate deal terms, one of our 
leadership team members or an experienced member will help, but we would like an investor 
in the deal to act as the Deal Lead.

We prefer to only invest in deals when we have Financial Information Rights and Pro Rata 
rights in follow-on financings. We have a standard side letter for those and other deal 
terms if needed.

As a policy, Wharton Alumni Angels does not participate in Rule 506(c) offerings or 
invest in 'pass-through' operating companies such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, 
S-corporations, and LLCs. Ask our leadership team for support if these are unfamiliar to 
you.

### What is the Due Diligence process? 

Full Members who are investing in the deal are in charge of performing due diligence. We 
can support the investors as needed based on their experience. Some information will be 
provided by the companies. Companies may have an online Data Room, but most early-stage 
companies will not. We typically store any information from the company or from other 
sources on the deal management platform. If investors wish to conduct other research on 
the market, technology or industry that is the responsibility of the investors in the 
deal. We have members who are experts in many fields, and investors can ask each other 
for support. If investors need guidance on deal terms, investor rights, or similar, we do 
have access to legal counsel when it is warranted. For the vast majority of deals, the 
terms are straight forward, and questions can be answered by experienced members.

### How are are Wharton Alumni Angels' deals syndicated for its members? 

We invest via a suitable Special-Purpose-Vehicle (SPV) usually a Delaware LLC. The 
Operating Agreements and Subscription Agreements are available on the member portal.

SPV expenses are paid by investors. For each investment the SPV collects an expense 
allocation from members to cover costs of the LLC (e.g., set-up, accounting, tax 
preparation, government tax or fees). There is an annual cap on these fees, thus the more 
our members invest the lower the expenses are as a percentage of invested capital.

Full Members contribute to expenses only when they invest. When they do not make a new 
investment there are no recurring fees.

Wharton Alumni Angels only collects expenses for actual expenses. Wharton Alumni Angels 
does not charge a management fee and does not collect carried interest.

### What securities are used for a typical investment? 

Each deal security type is unique and may be different from others. We've invested using 
Convertible Notes, SAFEs, Preferred Stock, and Debt with Warrant Coverage. Common stock 
deals are unusual.

As a policy, Wharton Alumni Angels does not participate in Rule 506(c) offerings, nor 
pass-through operating companies such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, 
S-corporations, and LLCs.

### Does Wharton Alumni Angels co-invest or share deals with other investors? 

We do often invite other angel networks or VC firms to invest in companies we are in 
contact with but, in doing so, we follow normal prudence and business etiquette. Before 
sharing any deal with others we obtain permission from the entrepreneur to share the deal 
as well as permission regarding which information we may share. Before sharing with other 
investors we make the investment fully available to Wharton Alumni Angels investors 
first, including in other regions around the world. Before sharing, we also make sure the 
entrepreneur commits to an allocation in the deal for our investors so that our investors 
are not excluded from the deal. Making a “backroom” deal that results in excluding other 
Wharton Alumni Angels members from the deal is prohibited by our Member Agreement and may 
result in loss of membership.

### How are deals tracked post investment? 

Investors have access to our SPV LP Portal. All financial information about an investor's 
deals, cost basis, current valuation, and other metrics and data are available via the LP 
portal.

We have designated members who act as Portfolio Managers. These Portfolio Managers, along 
with the Deal Leads continue to track the progress of portfolio companies and follow up 
with companies at least once per quarter. When we have information rights we follow up 
with the company to ensure they send financial reports, business reports and etc. We 
always communicate to the company that we want to be informed of follow on financing, 
even when we have pro rata rights.
